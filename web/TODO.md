# To-do list:
- Add _"Settings"_ button:
    - _Store method_
    - (maybe) _Color themes_
    - (maybe) _Language_
    - _Credits_
- Make _".actions"_ button works:
  - _Delete note_
  - _Export note_
  - _Share note_ (if "the server thing" will be done)
  - _Archive note_
- think how to store notes properly (instead of localStorage):
  - probably I'll go with options to save notes either on my hosted server (that I'll create for this idea) or same server, but self-hosted so users (if they will be) can set up their own notes storage and keep them safe on their server.
- maybe implement any editor framework, so it can use Markdown in text.
- maybe make it a desktop app (using rust and tauri. if rust will be used, the thing with storing notes disappears because I could be able to store them in files (e.g. .md)

And more easy tasks...

- ~~make "close" button (in main_actions) works.~~
- drink tea
- ~~add notifications on actions (save/favs etc)~~
